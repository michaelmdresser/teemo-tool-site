# teemo-tool-site

This is the website for the [Teemo Tool](https://github.com/michaelmdresser/teemo-tool) project. Uses data from the [API Server](https://github.com/michaelmdresser/teemo-tool-api).

Visit the site [here](https://teemotool.com).

## Developing

The `teemo.js` file is an artifact of the Typescript built but is included in the repo because the site is served from Github Pages. It should not be edited and should be treated purely as a build artifact necessary for serving the page.

`tsc -b` to compile the `teemo.ts` file to `teemo.js` with correct options.
